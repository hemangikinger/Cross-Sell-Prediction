An insurance company that provides medical insurance to its customers wants to know how many of their existing policyholders (customers) from last year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company.

What is an Insurance Policy?
An insurance policy is an arrangement by which a company undertakes to provide a guarantee of compensation for specified loss, damage, illness, or death in return for the payment of a specified premium. 
A premium is a sum of money that the customer needs to pay regularly to an insurance company for this guarantee.

What is Vehicle Insurance?
Vehicle insurance is insurance for cars, trucks, motorcycles, and other road vehicles where every year customer needs to pay a premium of certain amount to insurance provider so that they provide financial protection against physical damage or bodily injury resulting from traffic collisions and against liability that could also arise from incidents in a vehicle.
